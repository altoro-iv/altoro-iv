## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my bachelor's in computer science with a concentration in software engineering through Southern New Hampshire University. I only have 2 more terms left!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Foundations through the Odin Project, the Back-end Developer Path(OOP in Python) through Boot.dev, as well as going through the Computer Science career path on Codecademy. I feel like I haven't learned/retained as much as I would like through just college alone so I'm trying to develop my skillset in any way possible.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that will teach me something and reinforce knowledge, preferably web development or app development.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting into the field, would really love to land a job or internship.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my passion for fitness and how I'm planning on incorporating web/app development into it.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: altoro.iv@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have an obsession with reading and collecting books and currently have over 700. Trying to get to 1,000 so I can officially say I have a personal library because I guess that's the requirement these days.
